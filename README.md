# Udacity Full Stack nanodegree Project 1 - Movie trailer website

##Source code for a Movie Trailer website with lists of my favorite movies##

Generated files:

**fresh_tomatoes.html**  - This is the movie listing page

###Source files:###

** entertainment_center.py **
 
** fresh_tomatoes.py **

** media.py **

_All you need to view the final project is the file fresh_tomatoes.html_

Save the fresh_tomatoes.html file to the desktop and open it 

If you wish to regenerate this HTML file from source:

In a Python IDE or at Anaconda prompt, Run entertainment_center.py python file 
as follows: "python entertainment_center.py"

Fresh_tomatoes.html will be regenerated which will display the movies with 
poster and trailer.
